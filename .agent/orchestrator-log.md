# 6-Stage Orchestrator Log

Repository: `E:\DEV\cstd-help`
Branch: `main`
Started: 2026-06-28

## Global Preparation

- Status: clean on `main`, synced with `origin/main`.
- Recent commits checked: latest 5 requested; repository currently has 4 commits.
- Prompt files read from `C:\Users\12031\Desktop\AGENT_PROMPTS_MAIN_PACK`.
- CI workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.
- CI commands: install `requirements.txt`, run unit tests, compile Python, validate static site, deploy to Cloudflare Pages.
- Baseline verification:
  - `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test*.py"`: passed, 35 tests.
  - `python -m compileall -q .`: passed.
  - `python scripts/check_public_site.py`: passed, 10 report pages.

## Stage 1 - IMPROVE

- Prompt: `AGENT_IMPROVE_MAIN.txt`
- Goal: improve the historical review site with a product-visible capability that makes match review navigation more actionable.
- Start status: clean `main`, baseline CI commands passed.
- Plan:
  - Identify the next high-value continuation from the current report-history baseline.
  - Add an evidence-backed match overview surface that helps the player decide which replay to review first.
  - Add focused validation so the generated public site cannot regress silently.
- Result:
  - Added a coach priority queue to the history page.
  - Parsed each report's first structured finding into review focus, next action, success metric, and priority.
  - Rendered each match row with the real training focus and acceptance metric from that report.
  - Rebuilt `public` from the real report source.
- Local verification:
  - `python -m unittest tests.test_build_pages_site`: failed before implementation for missing fields, then passed.
  - `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test*.py"`: passed, 35 tests.
  - `python -m compileall -q .`: passed.
  - `python scripts/check_public_site.py`: passed, 10 report pages.
- Commit: `feat: add coach review priority queue` (`f24c0f6`).
- Push: pushed to `origin/main`.
- GitHub Actions / CI: passed, run `28299842160`.
- Risks:
  - Priority is derived from the report's existing finding priority plus real match outcome/death count, not from new external data.
- Next stage: Stage 2 IMPROVE.

## Stage 2 - IMPROVE

- Prompt: `AGENT_IMPROVE_MAIN.txt`
- Goal: add a cross-match trend board so repeated issues become a concrete training plan.
- Start status: clean `main`, stage 1 CI passed, local unit tests and static site validation passed.
- Previous-stage direction:
  - Stage 1 recommended generating a recent-trends summary from repeated report findings.
- Plan:
  - Aggregate report findings by focus/category across the current public report set.
  - Render a trend board on the history page with frequency, examples, next action, and acceptance metric.
  - Export the same trend data as JSON for later UI and automation work.
  - Add tests that fail before the aggregate trend generator exists.
- Result:
  - Added cross-match focus trend aggregation from real report findings.
  - Added a `最近反复问题` trend board to the history page.
  - Generated `public/review-trends.json` with schema version, priorities, examples, actions, and success metrics.
  - Extended static site validation to require the trend board and JSON payload.
- Local verification:
  - `python -m unittest tests.test_build_pages_site`: failed before implementation for missing trend generation, then passed.
  - `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test*.py"`: passed, 37 tests.
  - `python -m compileall -q .`: passed.
  - `python scripts/check_public_site.py`: passed, 10 report pages.
- Data check:
  - `public/review-trends.json`: 3 trend groups; top group appears in 5 matches.
- Commit: pending.
- Push: pending.
- GitHub Actions / CI: pending.
- Risks:
  - Trend grouping uses the exact report focus text; future work may normalize semantically similar focus names if they diverge.
- Next stage: Stage 3 UIUX.
